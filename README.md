- This project is travel spot recommendation service on demand forecasting for senior.
- I developed a recommendation system based on user-based collaborative filtering using tourism data.
- Demand forecasting was performed using the LSTM model.

And, you can view demo site with streamlit framework!
1. 'git clone' this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/abcd-EGH/jeju-spot-recommendation.git
```
2. Install streamlit on your system.
```
pip install streamlit
```
3. Run streamlit using the command line below.
```
streamlit run service
```
4. Then, you can now view demo site on your web browser. If the browser does not runs automatically, you are able to connect URL, 'http://localhost:8501/'.

I'm sorry that I could not provide data used for this project, because the data is provided by Jeju Tourism Organization and related companies.
